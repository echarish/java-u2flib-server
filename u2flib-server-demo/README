class.

https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/browsers-support-u2f/[U2F compatible web browser]
to link:https://localhost:8443/assets/registerIndex.html[https://localhost:8443/assets/registerIndex.html].

This will cause your browser to show a warning, which it is safe to bypass.

.Q&A
Why do I get https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/Libraries/Client_error_codes.html[error code 2]?::
    You are accessing the server using a URL that does not match the server's
	https://developers.yubico.com/U2F/App_ID.html[App ID].
	The App ID is set to `https://localhost:8443` by default, but you can change this in the
    https://github.com/Yubico/java-u2flib-server/blob/master/u2flib-server-demo/src/main/java/demo/Resource.java[Resource]
    class.
